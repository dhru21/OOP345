While working on this workshop, I learnt how to use the extern keyword in order to allow a variable to exist in another translation unit but be looked up in another as well as make that variable last a lifetime of the program. 
Internal linkage refers to only in scope of translation unit where as external linkage refers to things that exist beyond one translation unit. For example, In this code we used g_sysClock. 
Static variables reduced the amount of space utilized by the program. It is like a global variable and is available to all methods.
Upgrading the Event class in my program was quiet of a challenge. I added another copy constructor and an assignment operator. Also, I set the description variable to null before assigning characters to it, so there is no memory leak in during run time.
